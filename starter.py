# Simple Python code as a starter for a class on Python's variables, data types, and operators.

# Variable assignments
a = 5               # Integer
b = 3.2             # Floating point number

# Basic math operations
sum_of_a_b = a + b  # Addition
diff_of_a_b = a - b # Subtraction

# 1. Uncomment and complete the lines below
product_of_a_b = a*b
#quotient_of_a_b = 



print("\nOperations with Variables:")
print(f"The sum of a and b is {sum_of_a_b}")
print(f"The difference of a and b is {diff_of_a_b}")

# 2. Uncomment the lines below aftre
print(f"The product of a and b is {product_of_a_b}")
#print(f"The quotient of a and b is {quotient_of_a_b}")
