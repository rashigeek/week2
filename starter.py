# 1. Calculate the circumference of a circle by uncommenting the line below
#area_of_circle = 2 * pi *  # complete to obtain the appropriate formula 

# 2. Uncomment the line below and print the circumference of the circle
#print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area_of_circle}")

# 3. Uncomment and complete the lines below for type conversion. Use type casting.
# For example: int(x) will convert the type to integer
#age_as_float = 
#temperature_as_int = 

# An f-string allows you to include a variable in a string.

# 4. Uncomment the lines below and run them
#print(f"Original floating point number: {temperature}")
#print(f"Converted to integer: {temperature_as_int}")
#print(f"Original integer: {age}")
#print(f"Converted to float: {age}")

# Composite Data Types - Working with Lists
favorite_things = ['Python', 42, 3.14, 'AI', True]  # List with mixed data types

# Remember that the first item in a list has the index zero.
# You can print the first item in the list by using
print(f"The First item in the list is : {favorite_things[0]}")  # Prints the first item

# 5. Now uncomment and edit below to print the second and third items of the list
#print(f"The Second item in the list is : {}")  # Prints the second item
#print(f"The Third item in the list is : {}")  # Prints the third item

# Initialize variables
a = 10
b = 5

# 6. Addition - Add 'a' and 'b'. Store the result in 'add_result' and print it.
# add_result = 
#print(f"Addition: a + b = {add_result}")

# 7. Subtraction - Subtract 'b' from 'a'. Store the result in 'subtract_result' and print it.
# subtract_result = 
#print(f"Subtraction: a - b = {subtract_result}")

# 8. Multiplication - Multiply 'a' and 'b'. Store the result in 'multiply_result' and print it.
# multiply_result = 
#print(f"Multiplication: a * b = {multiply_result}")

# 9. Division - Divide 'a' by 'b'. Store the result in 'divide_result' and print it.
# divide_result = 
#print(f"Division: a / b = {divide_result}")

# 11. Access the first element of the list, check if it is even or odd, and print 0 for even and 1 for odd.
# HINT: Use the modulo operator (%) to check for evenness (even numbers give a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).
